# ESG Scoring API for Product Recommendation System

This project enhances a product recommendation system by integrating an **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)** scoring mechanism. The goal is to prioritize sustainable products in recommendations and provide ESG transparency for users.

---

## What is ESG?

ESG stands for:

- Environmental ‚Äì How a product impacts the planet (e.g., water usage, carbon footprint).
- Social ‚Äì Ethical aspects like labor conditions, health/safety, etc.
-Governance ‚Äì Transparency and responsible sourcing or compliance in production.

ESG model focuses mainly on Environmental and Ethical (Social) factors derived from product materials.

---

##  How ESG Scoring Works

This simulates ESG-related features and predict an ESG score between 0‚Äì100 using a custom model. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Features**   :
   - `material` (e.g., cotton, leather, bamboo, polyester)
   - `water_use` (litres)
   - `carbon_emission` (kg CO‚ÇÇ)
   - `ethical_rating` (scale 1‚Äì5)

2. **Processing**:
   - Features are generated using the function `generate_esg_columns(df)` from `esg_utils.py`
   - A scoring model (in `esg_module.py`) calculates the ESG score based on weighted environmental and ethical metrics.

3. **Output**:
   - `score` (0‚Äì100)
   - `badge` (Low, Medium, High)
   - `sustainable_alternative` (suggested alternative materials)

4. **Integration with Recommendation System**:
   - Boosts similarity scores for high ESG products
   - Filters out products with ESG score < 50 from top 3 recommendations
