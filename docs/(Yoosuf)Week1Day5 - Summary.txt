ESG Insights

Overview

The ESG analysis of the product_esg.csv dataset shows the sustainability performance across materials and countries.
Below are key findings based on the calculated ESG scores out of 100.

Top Sustainable Materials

The most sustainable materials are hemp, linen, and recycled cotton, each achieving an average ESG score of 100.0 
according to the analysis. This is likely due to low water usage, low carbon emissions, recyclability and high
ethical ratings. These materials should be used more often in the future to enhance overall sustainability.

Least Eco-Friendly Items

The least eco-friendly products are shown in India, with the lowest ESG scores observed for:
Product ID 10: Cotton, India, 13.33
Product ID 19: Cotton, India, 13.67
Product ID 1: Cotton, India, 14.00

These low scores are most likely because of a high water usage (e.g., 2700 liters for cotton) and moderate carbon 
emissions, with a non-recyclable status and lower ethical ratings. 

Average ESG Score by Country

High-Performing Countries: A majority of countries, including Finland, Norway, Netherlands, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sweden, 
Germany, France, Pakistan, Denmark, Canada, Brazil, Belgium, and Bangladesh, achieved an average ESG score of 100.0.

Moderately Performing Countries: Peru (84.33), Turkey (84.0), Mexico (83.67), and Egypt (83.33) show good performance, 
showing that it needs improvement in specific metrics like water usage or ethical ratings.

Low-Performing Countries: Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia average around 32.0, while New Zealand, Uruguay, Argentina, 
Australia, and South Africa range from 29.67 to 30.67. These scores are most likely because of higher carbon emissions
or water use.

Lowest Performers: China (26.0), Italy (21.22), Morocco (21.0), Portugal (20.67), and India (13.87) have low scores, 
with India showing the lowest average.
